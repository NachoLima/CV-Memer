        <p class="yadda">  I am a university student trying 
            to get my first job experience 
            as a dev.
            With special interest and 
            motivation on technology
            related studies, I am currently 
            switching from psychology to 
            technology trying to mix and 
            match what Iâ€™ve learned 
            along the way with what I aim 
            to know in the future.
            I enjoy working with others and 
            alone, exchanging opinions 
            and building team spirit.
            Creative, driven, helpful and 
            communicative.
            My hobbies involve playing video games, and sports in general despite having a clear preference for Football
